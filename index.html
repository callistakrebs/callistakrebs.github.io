        I’m a student at The Ohio State University where I study chemical
        engineering with a minor in computer science. I love reading, cooking,
        yoga, surfing, and pretty much all water sports.

        Last year, I had the opportunity to work for ExxonMobil as an engineer
        at one of their chemical manufacturing sites. Though the experience
        taught me a ton about engineering projects and the chemical
        manufacturing industry, this year, I wanted to try my hand at something
        new. I decided to explore the world of computer science and started
        learning to program, working on a few small projects here and there,
        participating in hackathons, picking up a minor in CS, and building this
        website.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to computer science, over the past year I've become
        increasingly interested in the biotechnology industry. This summer
        (2020), I'll be working for Illumina, a biotech company based in San
        Diego, California that produces genome-sequencing technology. I’m
        excited to explore the industry and learn more about genetic sequencing.

      <h2>HackOHI/O 2019</h2>
      <p>
        For me, exploring the computer science industry meant finally joining my
        friends in their 24-hour hackathons at Ohio State. This past fall, I
        joined a team with a few friends at HackOHI/O, a 24-hour programming
        marathon for Ohio State students. Over 800 people joined the competition
        and worked in the Ohio Union all weekend on various programming projects
        and company-sponsored challenges. My team and I developed an iOS app to
        recommend clothing choices to users based on weather and style. The app
        used Microsoft Azure Computer Vision technology to categorize users’
        clothing from an uploaded image. It was a great learning experience for
        me, learning how to use tools like Microsoft Azure and building software
        in a team. In the end, we won “Best New to Hack” award for developing an
        impressive product with no previous hackathon experience.
      </p>
      <h2>Brain Health Hack 2020</h2>
      <p>
        My second hackathon experience slightly overlapped with my interests in
        the biotech field. At the 2020 Brain Health Hack at OSU’s Wexner Medical
        Center, my friends and I worked in a team to develop an app that would
        help PTSD victims log and track their symptoms. The app, SymptomWatch,
        allowed users to log their symptoms after an episode or attack, keep
        track of how often they occurred, export the information to be sent to
        their doctor, and call an emergency contact if needed. The purpose of
        the app was to help victims of PTSD better communicate with their doctor
        and monitor their progress, allowing adjustments to treatment if needed.
        In the end, we got to present to a handful of healthcare professionals
        at The Wex, and the project won an award for “Most Technically
        Advanced.”
