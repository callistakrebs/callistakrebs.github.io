    <h1>Hi, I'm Callista</h1>

    <p>
      I graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in chemical
      engineering in May 2021. Since then, I moved to San Diego and started working in the biotech industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I haven't always been on the biotech track. My first internship was in the oil industry in 2019, through which
      I learned a lot about chemical engineering, but also learned that I didn't want to be a traditional chemical
      engineer. I wanted to work on new, exciting technologies in a cutting-edge field, not just move fluids through
      pipes and pumps. So, I turned to the world of computer science, and starting learning to program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucky for me, a handful of my best friends from college were software engineers, and they were more than willing
      to point me in the right direction. I started working on personal projects (like building this website), taking
      extra classes in CS, and participating in OSU's annual Hackathons. Over time, I learned a ton about programming
      and computer science, and I also learned that I really liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the meantime, I also learned that I really liked biotech. After interning in the field in 2020, it seemed
      like the industry was what I had been searching for: an industry beaming with exciting new ideas and
      cutting-edge technologies. And I wanted to be a part of it. So, I got a job in San Diego, packed up my stuff, and
      here
      we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love learning about new breakthroughs in our understanding of genetics and DNA through different books and
      podcasts, but I haven't lost touch with my interest in Computer Science. There's still a lot that I don't know,
      and I'm hoping to keep learning on my own time, and maybe one day I'll be able to combine these interests of mine.
      Stay tuned.

    <h2>HackOHI/O 2019</h2>
    <p>
      For me, exploring the computer science in undergrad meant joining my
      friends in their 24-hour hackathons at Ohio State. In Fall 2019, my friends and I made a team
      at HackOHI/O, a 24-hour programming marathon for Ohio State students. Over 800 people joined the competition
      and worked in the Ohio Union all weekend on various programming projects
      and company-sponsored challenges. My team and I developed an iOS app to
      recommend clothing choices to users based on weather and style. The app
      used Microsoft Azure Computer Vision technology to categorize users’
      clothing from an uploaded image. It was a great learning experience for
      me, learning how to use tools like Microsoft Azure and building software
      in a team. In the end, we won “Best New to Hack” award for developing an
      impressive product with no previous hackathon experience.

    <h2>Brain Health Hack 2020</h2>

    <p>
      My second hackathon experience overlapped with my interests in the
      biotech field. At the 2020 Brain Health Hack at OSU’s Wexner Medical
      Center, my friends and I worked in a team to develop an app that would
      help PTSD victims log and track their symptoms. The app, SymptomWatch,
      allowed users to log their symptoms after an episode or attack, keep
      track of how often they occurred, export the information to be sent to
      their doctor, and call an emergency contact if needed. The purpose of
      the app was to help victims of PTSD better communicate with their doctor
      and monitor their progress, allowing adjustments to treatment if needed.
      In the end, we got to present to a handful of healthcare professionals
      at The Wex, and the project won an award for “Most Technically
      Advanced.”
