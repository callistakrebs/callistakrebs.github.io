# Advent of Code 2024
This is a summary of my [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com) adventure! I've spent the last ~2.5 years working full time while getting my M.S. in computer science via Georgia Tech's OMSCS. When I finished my last 2 classes in December 2024, for the first time in a long time, I had some free time to pick up a just-for-fun and just-for-me coding project. Enter: Advent of Code 2024.

For each day, I completed the problem myself, and then asked ChatGPT how it would improve my code. Below are the summaries from each day, including my original code, ChatGPT's improved version, and a summary of what I learned that day.
