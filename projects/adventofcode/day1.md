# Advent of Code - Day 1
[< Advent of Code](index.html) [Next Day >](day2.html)

### My Code
```{.python .numberLines}
left = []
right = []
with open("day1.txt") as f:
    for line in f.readlines():
        line.replace("\n","")
        curr = line.split("   ")
        left.append(int(curr[0]))
        right.append(int(curr[1]))

left.sort()
right.sort()

right_count = {}
for i in range (len(right)):
    if right[i] in right_count.keys():
        right_count[right[i]] += 1
    else:
        right_count[right[i]] = 1 

score = 0
for i in range(len(left)):
    if left[i] in right_count.keys():
        score += left[i] * right_count[left[i]]
    else:
        score += left[i] * 0

print(score)
```
### ChatGPT's Improved Code
```{.python .numberLines}
from collections import Counter

# Initialize lists
left = []
right = []

# Read and process the file
with open("day1.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        # Strip newline characters and split the line into parts
        curr = line.strip().split("   ")
        # Append values to respective lists
        left.append(int(curr[0]))
        right.append(int(curr[1]))

# Sort the lists (not strictly necessary for the given logic but kept if needed elsewhere)
left.sort()
right.sort()

# Use Counter to simplify counting occurrences in the 'right' list
right_count = Counter(right)

# Calculate the score
score = sum(
    left[i] * right_count.get(left[i], 0) 
    for i in range(len(left))
)

# Print the final score
print(score)

```
# What I Learned
### `strip()`
* Newline characters can be stripped in a one line function call strip(). 
* Strip() with no arguments removes leading and trailing white spaces in a string. 
* You can also pass arguments to strip() to remove specified characters:

    ```{.python}
    my_string = "hello there !!!!! .."
    my_stripped_string = my_string.strip("!.")
    print(my_stripped_string)
    # Outputs "hello there "
    ```

### `collections.Counter`
* Collections.Counter() tallies the number of occurrences of elements in a list. The input is a list and the output is a dictionary where each element in the list is a key and the value is the number of times the element occurs in the list.
* Counter items return 0 count for missing elements instead of raising a `KeyError` 
* Elements can have 0 count, negative count
* Removing a key from the counter will remove all instances of the key in the iterator generated by `counter.elements()`
* You can also use Counter to generate lists with a certain number of elements. For example:

    ```{.python}
    a = Counter(a=3,b=2)
    sorted(a.elements())
    # outputs ['a','a','a','b','b']
    ```

### `dict.get()`
* We can use dict.get() when retreiving elements from a hashset to avoid `KeyError`. 
* The first argument to get() is the key you want to retrieve, and the second argument is the default return value if the key is not found.

### `sum()`
* We can use the `sum()` function to sum a certain operation over iterations in a loop.
* `sum()` takes an iterator as input in the form of:

    `sum([action] for i in range ([number of times]))`
* This will be the sum off all `[action]`s across `[number of times]` iterations
